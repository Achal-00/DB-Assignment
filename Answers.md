1. The relationship between the product and product_category entities is established by a foreign key column in the product table that
refers to the primary key in the product_category table. This foreign key is used to associate each product with a specific category.

2. For this we can use a foreign key constraint. This constraint ensures that the foreign key values in the product table corresponds to
existing primary key value in the referenced table.
